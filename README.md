## Explanatio
A Simple assembly Calculator<br>
This is a personal project where i wanted to work on a simple assembly calculator <br>
This calculator is **simple** meaning it can only perform **non-floating point** procedures (integers only) <br>
Up to this point in development this calculator only performs two basic operations: <br>
1) Adding **two non-floating point** numbers <br>
2) Subtracting **two non-floating point** numbers <br>
subtraction is performed through two's compliment of addition <br>
## Improvements
--> to be added multiplication and devision with a remainder<br>
*Note that all operation are **performed through addition** meanng multiplication will be repeated addition and division will be **repeated subtraction** that is **adding a negative number**_ <br> <br>
